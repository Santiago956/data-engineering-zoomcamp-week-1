# data-engineering-zoomcamp-week-1

This repository contains the materials and the solution for the **Week 1** homework of the **Data Engineering Zoomcamp** course by DataTalks.Club, focused on setting up the development environment using modern data engineering technologies.

## Module Objective
The goal this week was to introduce concepts of containerization and Infrastructure as Code (IaC), configuring an environment that will be used in the following weeks of the bootcamp.

**Topics Covered:**
*   **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Introduction and initial project configuration.
*   **Docker & Docker Compose:** Used to isolate services and manage multiple containers (PostgreSQL and PgAdmin).
*   **PostgreSQL:** Configuration of a relational database in a Docker container for data ingestion.
*   **Terraform:** Use of the IaC tool to provision resources on GCP (such as storage buckets and BigQuery datasets) safely and consistently.
